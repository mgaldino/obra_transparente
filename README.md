The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from the [insert number] data sources (citation needed) using R. We use the Targets @landau21 in [xxx #number] main files to run all of the code to generate the data for the xx figures and xx tables in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about xx hours.
