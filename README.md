Paper on the effects of project Obra Transparente

The repository has all the data and code for replicating the paper. The Data folder has all raw data used in the quantitative part of the paper. The code for the analysis is in a rmarkdown document, wihtin the paper.

The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from the [insert number] data sources (citation needed) using R. We use the Targets @landau21 in [xxx #number] main files to run all of the code to generate the data for the xx figures and xx tables in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about xx hours.
